2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   My biggest challenge to creating this submission was understanding the logic to the game in JavaScript. My background is in Java programming so the
   syntax looked familiar but understanding the nuances was a bit difficult since I have never worked with it before. I overcame this challenge by taking
   time to read through the lines provided in the tutorial and seeing how they would work with the game, and tinkering with them really helped as well.
   As I got to essentially "break" the code and watch it fail, and putting it back to the way it was and seeing it work again helped me really understand
   what was going on. I also looked at the JavaScript resources provided in the tutorial and skimming through those helped make things more clear, as little
   by little I could see the logic and also make a connection with the Java programming language in my head even though they are different languages.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   What are things a web developer can do to improve user experience?
   What the benefits of making webapps that work also offline and how can you determine if you should add that feature to your app during development?
   How do you make your website work well with mobile devices with everyone having a cellphone?
   What frameworks are best to use during the development of a website that makes the developer more productive but also deploy a quality product?
   Is a content management system like WordPress still relevent now a days? And how did it become so popular?
   What are the common things a developer can do to increase load times and page speeds on his website?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
